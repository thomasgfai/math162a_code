Brandeis Math 162a: Code Examples
Unit 4: Numerical Ordinary Differential Equations
==========================
euler.py - Demonstrates the simple first-order forward Euler method for
integrating an ordinary differential equation. If the program is run with "python euler.py >out" so that the data is sent to a file called "out", then within Gnuplot the results can be shown with the command:

plot 'out' u 1:2 t 'Computed solution', 'out' u 1:3 t 'Exact solution'

The differences between the two can be shown with the command:

plot 'out' u 1:4 t 'Error'

e_stab.py - Tests the stability of the choice of timestep in the forward Euler method
